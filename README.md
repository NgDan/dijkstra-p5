 - Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks.

 - The user can select a starting point, a few nodes on the map and an ending point

 - The radius within which the nodes will connect can also be controlled

 - This implementation is in no way perfect but was a fun exercise that taught me a few things
